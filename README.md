Turns In Terms of N and C

You and your N friends play a game to decide who is the luckiest. All of you start with C coins. Every turn, anyone with at least one coin puts a single coin into a pile, and one person who put a coin in the pile is, uniformly at random, chosen to take the entire pile. The game ends when one person has all of the coins. What is the expected number of turns it takes for this game to end, in terms of N and C? Optionally, what else can you say about this game?
